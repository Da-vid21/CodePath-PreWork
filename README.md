## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

This are my top 3 apps I use and I want to improve
1. **Youtube**
* I want to have song detector built into the voice search feature to search for music and automatically add it to a playlist
* Have a sleep timer for playing videos

2. **Tiktok**
* View all the duets/stitches of videos
* AutoScroll feature for videos

3. **WhatsApp**
* Send silent messages that sends notification to other user without sound
* Send scheduled messages if two users have different timezones

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

* Figuring out where the tools where was a little confusing but the gifs helped
